# opti-freq
`opti-freq` is a lightweight utility library that helps opti-freqmize the frequency of function 
executions, enhancing application performance. It provides efficient implementations for debounce and throttle functions, making it easier to handle events like typing, scrolling, or other
repetitive user interactions without degrading performance.

# Installation

You can install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install opti-freq
```
# Features
### Debounce: 
`Delays` the execution of a function until a specified amount of time has passed since the last
`event`. Useful for scenarios like preventing an API call on every keystroke in a search input.

### Throttle: 
Limits the execution of a function to at most once within a specified time interval. Ideal for scenarios like reducing the frequency of scroll or resize event listeners.

## Usage Examples
Here are some examples of how to use debounce and throttle in a React.js application:

# Debounce Function

```javascript
import { debounce } from 'opti-freq';

function App() {
  const handleInputChange = debounce((event) => {
    console.log('Input value:', event.target.value);
  }, 300);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Debounce Example</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Type something..."
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
The handleInputChange function is debounced by 300 milliseconds.
The function will only execute if the user stops typing for 300ms, avoiding unnecessary frequent
API calls.

# Throttle Function
The `throttle` function ensures a function is executed at most once during a specified time interval.

```javascript 
import { throttle } from 'opti-freq';

function App() {
  const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
    console.log('Scroll event triggered');
  }, 500);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, [handleScroll]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Throttle Example</h1>
      <div style={{ height: '1500px', background: '#f0f0f0' }}>
        Scroll down to test throttle
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Explanation:
The `handleScroll` function is throttled to execute at most once every 500 milliseconds.
This reduces the number of times the scroll handler is invoked during continuous scrolling,
preventing performance bottlenecks.

# API Reference
## Debounce

```javascript
debounce(func, delay)
```

#### Parameters:
`func:` The function to debounce.
`delay:` The delay time in milliseconds.
#### Returns:
A new debounced function that executes func only after the specified delay since the last invocation.

## Throttle
```javascript
throttle(func, interval)
```

#### Parameters:
`func:` The function to throttle.
`interval:` The interval time in milliseconds.
#### Returns: 
A new throttled function that executes func at most once per interval.

# Real-World Use Cases
## Debounce
#### Search Bar Input:
When a user types in a search bar, debounce can delay triggering the search API
call until the user pauses typing. This reduces redundant API calls and opti-freqmizes performance.

## Throttle
#### Scroll Event Listener:
Throttle can limit the frequency of executions for scroll-related
calculations or re-renders, improving performance during continuous scrolling.
